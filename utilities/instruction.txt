Instruction to Hangman Game:

    When the game starts, you will enter your name, then the level of difficulty of the game.
    
    There are 3 levels, easy, medium and hard.
    
    A random word will then be chosen based on the level and hidden under symbols '---',
    
    1 '-' represents 1 letter and you are allowed to guess 1 letter at a time. 
    
    You are allowed 7 wrong guesses and each incorrect guess will contribute 1 more pattern to the hangman drawing.
    
    A box of all the available letters that you can enter will be provided for your reference.
    
    You will lose when the drawing of hangman is completed.
    
    You can win when you guess all letters in the chosen word correctly and with less than 7 wrong guesses.
    
    Score will be calculated with a base of 100 point per correct guess and you would get more if you have consecutive right guesses.
    
    Your name and score will be compared and placed into the ranking board when the game round is done.
